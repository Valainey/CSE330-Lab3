To increase the security of users' information, we add the confirm password buttion. 
If the contents of password and confirm password are not match, the user can not login to the website page and he needs to check his account again.
There are two buttons in our login page. The information will be stored in our local databse when we register a new user. After that, we will use the existed user information to 
login. If all the information can match with our users table in database, the user can redirect to the home.page.
